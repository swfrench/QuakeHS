Miscellaneous Haskell tools for seismology
------------------------------------------

Long-term goals:
* Better FDSN StationXML support
* Interaction with the IRIS / FDSN Web Service
* Waveform data file (SAC,mseed) manipulation, likely via FFI
* Various tools for common calculations in the sphere
* Local mirroring / query of Global CMT project source info
